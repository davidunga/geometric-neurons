  authors: "Paolo Viviani, Tamar Flash"
  date: 1995
  DOI: "10.1037/0096-1523.21.1.32"
  abstract: |
    This study contrasts two approaches to movement planning by analyzing the drawing of complex two-dimensional trajectories. It examines whether the covariations of kinematic and geometrical parameters, formalized by the two-thirds power law and the isochrony principle, can be derived from the minimum-jerk model hypothesis. The findings indicate a satisfactory convergence regarding the relationship between tangential velocity and curvature (two-thirds power law). However, global isochrony could not be deduced from the optimal control hypothesis, suggesting that velocity scaling within movement subunits aligns with the minimum-jerk hypothesis.
  mainResults:
    - The two-thirds power law, relating tangential velocity and curvature, aligns with the minimum-jerk model.
    - Global isochrony is not derivable from the optimal control hypothesis.
    - Velocity scaling within movement subunits supports the minimum-jerk hypothesis.
